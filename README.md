# Hogarth-DevTest

## Hogarth´s assesment for web developer vacancy :rocket:

# Exercise 1 :computer:

Add a new hero section.
The current website contains one hero section that shows an image of the moon. You’re tasked to add a new section
for space exploration. The new section needs to fit next to the current one instead of on top of it. On mobile, the sections
should stack on top of each other.

### Extra points
- Add a link on the new section that goes to http://space.com/
- Fix the alignment of the background image to be always centered

# Exercise 2
Fix the order of the timeline.
The current timeline has the correct order in the HTML but it shows differently on the screen. You need to modify the
HTML and CSS to make sure the order is correct (by ascending date) on all screen sizes.

### Extra points
- Cards style should stay exactly the same

# Exercise 3
Support the gallery on older browsers.
The current gallery uses the new CSS grid to position the items. Since we want to support older browsers, you’re tasked to
override the grid code and use floats, flex, or similar solutions. Make sure that the gallery will keep same structure and
behavior on all viewports.

### Extra points
- Check for CSS grid support and only use the override code where it's not supported
